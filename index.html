          We're going to see <strong>Mr. Worldwide</strong> himself — Pitbull —
          live in Amsterdam! Get ready to dance like nobody's watching and make
          memories that will last forever.

          This birthday isn’t just about candles and cake. It’s about reminding
          you how deeply you are loved, how much you are appreciated, and how
          magical life can be when we're together.
