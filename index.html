        <h1>Happy Birthday, Raika-Zaika! 🎂</h1>
        <p>
          I am so happy that we got to see how we grow up, we saw each others'
          ups and downs. We have went through laughter, chaos, late-night talks,
          and total weirdness. You are more than a BFF to me. Meeting you gifted
          me with a sister from another mister for life. You are stuck with me!
          MUHAHAHA!
          <br /><br />
          Today, it's your turn to be celebrated for the energy you bring into
          this world.
          <br /><br />
          I LOVE YOU! Yours, <br /><br />
          The brownie to your blondie
        </p>

        <p>✨Your adventure begins here... ✨</p>
